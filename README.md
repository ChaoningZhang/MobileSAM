# Faster Segment Anything (MobileSAM)
:pushpin: MobileSAM paper is available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371851844_Faster_Segment_Anything_Towards_Lightweight_SAM_for_Mobile_Applications) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14289.pdf). 

:pushpin: **Support for ONNX model export**. Feel free to test it on your devices and share your results with us.

:pushpin: **A demo of MobileSAM** running on **CPU** is open at [hugging face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhkim2810/MobileSAM). On our own Mac i5 CPU, it takes around 3s. On the hugging face demo, the interface and inferior CPUs make it slower but still works fine. Stayed tuned for a new version with more features! You can also run a demo of MobileSAM on [your local PC](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM/tree/master/app).

:star: **How is MobileSAM trained?** MobileSAM is trained on a single GPU with 100k datasets (1% of the original images) for less than a day. The training code will be available soon.

:star: **How to Adapt from SAM to MobileSAM?** Since MobileSAM keeps exactly the same pipeline as the original SAM, we inherit pre-processing, post-processing, and all other interfaces from the original SAM. Therefore, by assuming everything is exactly the same except for a smaller image encoder, those who use the original SAM for their projects can **adapt to MobileSAM with almost zero effort**.
 
:star: **MobileSAM performs on par with the original SAM (at least visually)** and keeps exactly the same pipeline as the original SAM except for a change on the image encoder. Specifically, we replace the original heavyweight ViT-H encoder (632M) with a much smaller Tiny-ViT (5M). On a single GPU, MobileSAM runs around 12ms per image: 8ms on the image encoder and 4ms on the mask decoder. 

* The comparison of ViT-based image encoder is summarzed as follows: 

    Image Encoder                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  611M   | 5M
    Speed      |  452ms  | 8ms

* Original SAM and MobileSAM have exactly the same prompt-guided mask decoder: 

    Mask Decoder                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  3.876M   | 3.876M
    Speed      |  4ms  | 4ms

* The comparison of the whole pipeline is summarized as follows:

    Whole Pipeline (Enc+Dec)                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  615M   | 9.66M
    Speed      |  456ms  | 12ms

:muscle: **Is MobileSAM faster and smaller than FastSAM? Yes!** 
MobileSAM is around 7 times smaller and around 5 times faster than the concurrent FastSAM. 
The comparison of the whole pipeline is summarzed as follows: 
Whole Pipeline (Enc+Dec)                                      | FastSAM | MobileSAM 
:-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
Parameters      |  68M   | 9.66M
Speed      |  64ms  |12ms

:muscle: **Does MobileSAM aign better with the original SAM than FastSAM? Yes!** 
FastSAM is suggested to work with multiple points, thus we compare the mIoU with two prompt points (with different pixel distances) and show the resutls as follows. Higher mIoU indicates higher alignment. 
mIoU                                     | FastSAM | MobileSAM 
:-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
100      |  0.27   | 0.73
200      |  0.33  |0.71
300      |  0.37  |0.74
400      |  0.41  |0.73
500      |  0.41  |0.73








## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Mobile Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
cd MobileSAM; pip install -e .
```

## Demo

Once installed MobileSAM, you can run demo on your local PC or check out our [HuggingFace Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhkim2810/MobileSAM).

It requires latest version of [gradio](https://gradio.app).

```
cd app
python app.py
```

## <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started
The MobileSAM can be loaded in the following ways:

```
from mobile_sam import sam_model_registry, SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, SamPredictor

model_type = "vit_t"
sam_checkpoint = "./weights/mobile_sam.pt"

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

mobile_sam = sam_model_registry[model_type](checkpoint=sam_checkpoint)
mobile_sam.to(device=device)
mobile_sam.eval()

predictor = SamPredictor(mobile_sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from mobile_sam import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator

mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(mobile_sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```

## ONNX Export
**MobileSAM** now supports ONNX export. Export the model with

```
python scripts/export_onnx_model.py --checkpoint ./weights/mobile_sam.pt --model-type vit_t --output ./mobile_sam.onnx
```

Also check the [example notebook](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM/blob/master/notebooks/onnx_model_example.ipynb) to follow detailed steps.
We recommend to use `onnx==1.12.0` and `onnxruntime==1.13.1` which is tested.
