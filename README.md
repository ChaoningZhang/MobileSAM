# Faster Segment Anything (MobileSAM)

:pushpin: MobileSAM paper is available at [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14289.pdf).

:grapes: Updates
* 2023/06/28 Thanks a lot to [Grounding-SAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything) for combining Grounding-DINO and MobileSAM into [Grounded-MobileSAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything/tree/main/EfficientSAM)

:star: **MobileSAM** performs on par with the original SAM (at least visually) and keeps exactly the same pipeline as the original SAM except for a change on the image encoder. Specifically, we replace the original heavyweight ViT-H encoder (632M) with a much smaller Tiny-ViT (5M). On a single GPU, MobileSAM runs around 12ms per image: 8ms on the image encoder and 4ms on the mask decoder. 

* The comparison of ViT-based image encoder is summarzed as follows: 

    Image Encoder                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  611M   | 5M
    Speed      |  452ms  | 8ms

* Original SAM and MobileSAM have exactly the same prompt-guided mask decoder: 

    Mask Decoder                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  3.876M   | 3.876M
    Speed      |  4ms  | 4ms

* The comparison of the whole pipeline is summarized as follows:

    Whole Pipeline (Enc+Dec)                                      | Original SAM | MobileSAM 
    :-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
    Parameters      |  615M   | 9.66M
    Speed      |  456ms  | 12ms

:heart: **Is MobileSAM faster and smaller than FastSAM? Yes, to our knowledge!** 
MobileSAM is around 7 times smaller and around 5 times faster than the concurrent FastSAM. 
The comparison of the whole pipeline is summarzed as follows: 
Whole Pipeline (Enc+Dec)                                      | FastSAM | MobileSAM 
:-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
Parameters      |  68M   | 9.66M
Speed      |  64ms  |12ms

:heart: **Is MobileSAM better than FastSAM for performance? Yes, to our knowledge!** 
FastSAM is suggested to work with multiple points, thus we compare the mIoU with two prompt points (with different pixel distances) and show the resutls as follows. Our MobileSAM is better than FastSAM under this setup to align with the original SAM. 
mIoU                                     | FastSAM | MobileSAM 
:-----------------------------------------:|:---------|:-----:
100      |  0.27   | 0.73
200      |  0.33  |0.71
300      |  0.37  |0.74
400      |  0.41  |0.73
500      |  0.41  |0.73



:heart: **How to Adapt from SAM to MobileSAM?** Since MobileSAM keeps exactly the same pipeline as the original SAM, we inherit pre-processing, post-processing, and all other interfaces from the original SAM. The users who use the original SAM can adapt to MobileSAM with zero effort, by assuming everything is exactly the same except for a smaller image encoder in the SAM.

:heart: **How is MobileSAM trained?** MobileSAM is trained on a single GPU with 100k datasets (1% of the original images) for less than a day. The training code will be available soon.




## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Mobile Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
cd MobileSAM; pip install -e .
```


## <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started
The MobileSAM can be loaded in the following ways:

```
from mobile_encoder.setup_mobile_sam import setup_model
checkpoint = torch.load('../weights/mobile_sam.pt')
mobile_sam = setup_model()
mobile_sam.load_state_dict(checkpoint,strict=True)
```

Then the model can be easily used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt:

```
from segment_anything import SamPredictor
device = "cuda"
mobile_sam.to(device=device)
mobile_sam.eval()
predictor = SamPredictor(mobile_sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from segment_anything import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator

mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(mobile_sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```
